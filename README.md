# outdoor-sports-planner
This is the repo for the outdoor sports planner app, developed as the capstone project for the CU Boulder Online MSCS class in software architecture for big data.

# Backlog (unordered)

For next assignment:
* Copy app.py into different repo and link it with Heroku
* Figure out a good way in which app.py can then handle the data collectors and the data gateway for the assignment


Add database set up to the deployment CI/CD pipeline. As long as I don't have that, have app.py set up the database. Or even use something like alembic?
