# One approach is to use the official install script:
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir poetry

# Install dependencies (system-wide or in a virtual environment)
# Typically you might run `poetry config virtualenvs.create false`
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false
RUN poetry install --no-interaction --no-ansi

# Now copy the rest of your source code
